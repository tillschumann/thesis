\chapter{Results}

The generated mouse brain models, the programs and an example simulation are presented in this chapter.

\section{Mouse brain model properties}
Three different circuits (see Table \ref{table:circuits}) are generated: The full mouse brain circuit,
a smaller circuit that contains 25 percent of the full mouse brain circuit and
$\frac{1}{300}$ of the full circuit. The percentage is related to the number of neurons inside
the circuit. The connections are generated based on the selection of neurons. In principle
number of connections should be of the same proportion as number of neurons.

\begin{table}[ht!]
\centering
%\begin{centering}
    \begin{tabular}{ | l | l | r | r | r |}
    \hline
    Identifier & ratio & neurons & synapses & total size \\ \hline \hline

    \end{tabular}
%    \end{centering}
    \caption[Generated mouse brain circuits]{Generated mouse brain circuits. The circuits \emph{threehundredths}, \emph{quarter} and \emph{full} were created for testing and debugging on different scales.
All circuits were generated with identical parameters, only the input neuron file varies.}

\label{table:circuits}
\end{table}

The generated full mouse brain circuit contains around 74 million neurons and 660 billion synapses.
The simulation uses 12 parameters from the neuron file.
The file contains further parameters which are used for the connection generation and visualization,
like coordinates and neuron classifications. In total the neuron file is around 9 GB.
The synapse file contains only essential parameters for the simulation.
There are five synapse parameter per connection. This results in 15 TB of data
for the long range connectivity and 600 GB for the short range connectivity.
Thus, the generated circuit contains around 16 TB of data and it is split in three HDF5
files (neuron file, long range synapses file and short range synapses file).
The properties for the smaller circuits are equivalent.

\section{Manipulation of circuit}

The connection generation implementations accept a set of command line arguments.
The arguments allow to influence the circuit generation.
All accepted arguments are listed in table \ref{tab:longrangeargs}.
Besides data path manipulations the voxel experiment assignment can be 
manipulated on different levels. The number of used experiments can be specified
and limited. The interpolation can be enabled and limited to a range.
Further, the available voxel information can be mirrored to the other hemisphere.
Apart from this, the voxel experiment assignment can be exported to a file.
This file can be manipulated externally and imported again.
The weights of all created synapses can be strengthened by a factor.
This is necessary for reduces models.
\begin{table}[ht!]

    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Short range generation arguments to influence program execution.}
    \label{tab:shortrangeargs}
\end{centering}
\end{table}

The short range generation only accepts path manipulations and weight strengthening.
The arguments are listed in table \ref{tab:shortrangeargs}.

\section{NEST import module}

One simulation case (see Appendix \ref{ambmusecase}) of the mouse brain model is used in this thesis for performance evaluations.
Never the less, more use-cases are possible with the given implementations.
In general the neuron load module can be used as the neuron create function
and the synapses load module can be used as the connect function (see \url{www.nest-simulator.org/neural_simulations}).
Further, the given circuit can be loaded and adapted (e.g. use offsets or scaling factors for parameters).
Loaded neurons can be divided into subnets. 
The \emph{SLI} functionality allows to access these subnets.
Thus, the grouping performed with the subnet dataset is available for all \emph{SLI} functions.
Stimulus generator and \emph{Spikedetector} or \emph{Multimeter} can be used to stimulate
and observe specific neurons, respectively.
More use-cases are possible: For example the \emph{SLI} connect functions can be used to strengthening or weakening the connections between two
subnets of the circuit.

An example SLI script is listed below.
It loads neurons and synapses from the specified files,
set a stimulus to neurons and connects neurons to a Spikedetector.
The example (see Figure \ref{fig:exa:nestimport}) is similar to the tested use-case.

\subsection{Import neurons}
The import neuron module can be called with the function \emph{SLI} function  \emph{H5NeuronCsX}. It loads all neurons with its parameters
from the given HDF5 file. The function expects $8$ input parameters:
\begin{itemize}
      \item Name of the used neuron model
      \item A list of dataset/parameter names, which are loaded from the hdf5 file and written to the neuron model
      \item A list of factor: The parameters are multiplied by the values
      \item A list of offsets: The parameters are increased by the values
      \item Name of the a subnet dataset (String).
The subset has to contain for each neuron an integer value.
The neurons are grouped together by this subnet value.
      \item Filepath to the HDF5 neuron file
\end{itemize}
It returns the neuron id of the first neuron it creates.

\section{Full mouse brain simulation}
The full mouse brain simulation was executed successfully on $6$ racks of the JUQUEEN system.
For the simulation the full mouse brain model is loaded with a synapse weight strengthening of $10$.
The strengthening increases the diffusion of activity.
It enables the activation of most neurons.

   \label{fig:sim}
\end{figure}

Figures \ref{fig:sim} shows spiking activity for the given network.
Because of the strong strengthening, the whole model excites and run into numerical errors
after a few milliseconds. But the run illustrates the possibility of the full mouse brain model
simulation. Even though the model is still under development, first experiments allow an insight 
into its behaviour.


\chapter{Discussion}
The generated model and the performance of the implementations are discussed.

\section{Mouse brain model extensions}
The given mouse brain model contained less synapses than there are in a living mouse.
The Allen Brain Atlas does not have injections for all brain regions.
Thus, for some regions the connections information are missing.
An interpolation enables to generate a full mouse brain model from incomplete experimental data.
To create a full mouse brain model anyway, the circuit generation was extended by an interpolation.
The interpolation, which are applied to the long range connection generation, introduces errors.
For illustration Figure \ref{interpolationdistance} shows the locality of missing voxels in one slice.
The quality of the interpolation can be estimated from distance between each voxel and the nearest injected voxel (color scale in Figure \ref{interpolationdistance}).
It highlights problematic regions.
\begin{figure}[ht!]

\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{pictures/distance_x_y_70.eps}
\caption[Plotted values from the nearest neighbor algorithm]{Plotted values from the nearest neighbor algorithm. One sees the distance to the next injected voxel.}
\label{interpolationdistance}
\end{figure}
If more injection experiments become available, they can easily integrated into
the circuit generation.



\section{Data format usability}
The HDF5 data format for neuron parameters is used as received from the Neurorobotics team of the Blue Brain Project.
Because of the small size of the file (9 GB) in comparison to the synapse dataset (15 TB), the performance improvement by changing
to a transposed data format can be neglected. Thus, there is still advantage of having different datasets and being able
to add new datasets/parameters. It also implies that the generation script does not have to be converted and no 
conversion scripts are needed. The synapse data format focuses on an efficient storage of all essential values and parameters.
The self descriptive format allows a visualization and adoptions of the parameters.

\section{Long range connections generation}
Moving the best injection per voxel search outside the main iteration
avoids unnecessary calculations and reduces the complexity of the main iteration.
In the sequential algorithm, parts of the connections are regenerated.
This is avoided by selecting the best injection per voxel beforehand.

Optimization of the linear acceptance rejection function (see paragraph \emph{Linear acceptance rejection optimization} in chapter 2.2)
reduces the complexity of picking post-synaptic neurons.
For the full circuit this corresponds to a reduction of the complexity order  by two.
Using all cores inside the function gives a further speed up.
Each thread has to pick $~\frac{10,000}{N_{threads}}$ voxels instead of
$10,000$.

The program execution takes around 15h on the Blue Brain 4 using 2048 nodes for the full circuit.
Each node uses all threads. Optimized collective writing operations could 
lower the needed execution time,
but is not feasible, because the generation script will be executed only a few times
and the computational resources are given.

\section{Short range connections generation}
We ported the sequential algorithm directly to a parallel implementation without changing it.
We introduce a Master-Slave aprraoch to manage the work distribution.
It enables an easy distribution of the independent iterations.
The critical part of the implementation is the IO because the number of created synapses is not known in the beginning.
Therefore, the file size cannot be calculated beforehand, which is mandatory for efficient writing to HDF5 files. 
By using a buffer or temporary files this problem can be avoided.
Because of the given resources (Blue Brain 4),
writing all synapses to buffer is feasible (already for a small number of nodes the created synapses fit in memory).
The buffer implementation, which behaves like a queue, is efficient in terms of writing to disk and writing to file
if the queue chunks are large enough. Using larger chunks leads to 
a higher utilization of the theoretical bandwidth. Additionally, it leads to less independent
write operations which reduces the waiting time in serialization mechanisms.

The program execution takes around half an hour on the Blue Brain 4 using 256 nodes for the full circuit.
Two MPI ranks per node are launched. Optimizing the load balance could lead a better performance.
But it is not feasible, because the generation script will be executed only a few times
and the computational resources are given.

\section{Import circuit}
Loading the mouse brain model inside of NEST is the main goal of the thesis.
Therefore, NEST is extended with two import modules, which enable to import the
generated mouse brain model. To show that the implemented algorithms are feasible, 
the circuit properties which affect the load balance, are analysed.
The synapse import module has to load around $16$ TB of data for the full mouse brain model.
The neuron import module has to load $9$ GB of data.
Therefore, only the efficiency of the synapse import module is analysed.
Timings of the neuron import module are negligible.
The performance characteristics of the implemented Algorithm \ref{alg:import:synapses} are presented.
The IO performance of the implementation affects mainly the usability.
Runs on different scales should give detailed information about the reached bandwidth.
Therefore, IBM Blue Gene /Q systems in Lugano (Blue Brain 4) and in J\"{u}lich (JUQUEEN) are used.

\newpage
During development the connect step was identified as the bottleneck.
Therefore, we introduced thread parallelism of the \emph{Connect} step (see chapter \ref{sec:speedup:connect}).
By the following measurements these optimizations are applied.

In the course of a scalability workshop in Forschungszentrum J\"{u}lich we were able to run
our implementation at different scales on JUQUEEN.
Findings of the \emph{Read} step gotten from the workshop are presented in \ref{sec:speedup:load}.
Optimizations are not included inside the implementation, yet.
\begin{table}[ht!]

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|p{1.9cm}|p{2.1cm}|l|}

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Properties of scaling runs}
\label{schumann:tbl:runs}
\end{table}

Two weak scaling and one strong scaling scenarios were tested on the JUQUEEN.
Therefore, the total executing time of the synapse import module were measured.
The properties of the scaling runs are listed in Table \ref{schumann:tbl:runs}.

The amount of data read in the import module depends on the number of synapse parameters $N_{params}$,
the number of read synapses per iteration $N_{block}$ and the number of ranks $N_{ranks}$.
This results in a bandwidth for a measured wall-clock time $\Delta T$ of:
\begin{equation}
b = sizeof(float) * N_{params} * \frac{N_{block} * N_{ranks}}{\Delta T}
\label{eq:band}
\end{equation}
We use the equation \ref{eq:band} to normalize the scaling runs.
\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{pgfplots/bandwidth.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption[Bandwidth comparisons at different scales]{Bandwidth comparisons at different scales (see Table \ref{schumann:tbl:runs}).
The plotted values are taken from Table \ref{schumann:tbl:scalruns}.
The \emph{theoretical} line shows the approximate bandwidth peak of the system.}
\label{schumann:fig:bandwidth}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{schumann:fig:bandwidth} plots the measured bandwidths for the runs over number of nodes.
The resulted bandwidths tackles around $5\%$ of the peak bandwidth.
All runs give similar results. The difference of strong versus weak scaling runs seems to be negligible.
The amount of data that is loaded does not influence the results.
The reached bandwidth only correlates with the number of racks.
For both IBM Blue Gene /Q systems the number of IO nodes scales linear with the number of racks.
Therefore, we cannot conclude if the number of IO nodes or the number of nodes limit the
bandwidth.

A more detailed look on the task scale should give more insights.
An instrumented version of the implementation with scorep gives us wall-clock timings of each task.
The tasks are \emph{Read}, \emph{Def. Node}, \emph{Sort}, \emph{Alltoall} and \emph{Connect} and relate to the
steps of Algorithm \ref{alg:import:synapses} (see Figure \ref{fig:ConnectInsideIteration}).
We execute the instrumented module on different scales.
We analyse the measurements with Scalasca (see Appendix \ref{appendix:scalasca}).
The runtime behaviour is similar for all runs.
The wall-clock timings of \emph{Sort} and \emph{Det. Node} are constant.
They depend on the buffer size, which is fixed for all runs.
Therefore, we can skip the steps in the analysis.
For illustration, we present the runtime proportion of each task for the 1st scaling runs.
The mean percentage for each tasks over all nodes is calculated (see Figure \ref{schumann:fig:taskratios}).
\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{pgfplots/taskratios.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption[Task proportions of total wall-clock timings at different scales]{Task proportions of total wall-clock timings at different scales.
 The displayed percentages are the means of percentages for all nodes.
 The values are extracted from the 1st scaling run (see Table \ref{schumann:tbl:runs}).
 }
\label{schumann:fig:taskratios}
\end{figure}

\emph{Read} and \emph{Alltoall} take most of the time at all scales.
Comparing the proportions with Figure \ref{schumann:fig:bandwidth}, we conclude that
\emph{Det. Node}, \emph{Sort} and \emph{Connect} scale approximately linear with the number of racks.

%\subsection{Load balance}
%The neurons are distributed equably on all processes based on equation \ref{eq:processfromid}.
%But the number of incoming synapses varies between the neurons.
%Therefore a memory imbalance could occur between the processes.
%To analyse the imbalance, an analysing script iterates over the \emph{syn} dataset and counts
%the number of incoming synapses per neuron. Normalized results are plotted in box-plot diagrams 
%in Figure \ref{fullcircuitdist}.
%It shows an increasing imbalance of synapses per process with increasing number of processes.

For the interpretations of the plots, one has to take into account that different parts of the algorithm
(\emph{Read} and \emph{Alltoall}) contain mpi collective operations.

\subsection{Read step}
\label{sec:speedup:load}
The efficiency of the \emph{Read} step is bounded by the IO bandwidth of the system.
Blue Brain 4 and JUQUEEN have a theoretical bandwidth of around $8$ GB/s per rack.

Apparently, \emph{Read} and \emph{Alltoall} affect mainly the run time of our module.
\emph{Read} performs IO. It uses the HDF5 library to load synapses from disk and copy it into the internal data structure.
\emph{Alltoall} exchanges synapses between the ranks. Both steps contain collective MPI operations.
A detailed look at the call stack of the used H5Read function shows that the called MPI read operation is non-collective.
Using the HDF5 property list interface, we identify that the internal data structure (see Figure \ref{fig:synapsebuffer}) of the import module prevents HDF5 from using collective read operations.
A collective read operation could result in better read performance.
Therefore, a comparison of collective versus independent read operations should show possible benefits.
Because of the limited time at the workshop, we focus on the comparison of a reduced algorithm,
which allows an easy change of the internal data structure.
The adapted data structure eliminates \emph{rank\_id} and \emph{pre\_neuron} from \emph{Synapse} (see Figure \ref{fig:synapsebuffer}).
We can provide two test implementations with and without adapted data structure.

 JUQUEEN.}
 \label{fig:indiVScollecBand}
\end{figure}
The new algorithm reduces the iterations to the \emph{Read} step with a following MPI barrier.
The MPI barrier should simulate any \emph{collective} read operations inside the \emph{Alltoall} task.

\end{figure}

\newpage
Figure \ref{schumann:fig:indiVScollec} illustrates the benefit of collective versus independent read operations
on JUQUEEN for 16 racks.
Even though the mean time of the read operations is similar, the serializations of the read calls affects the
imbalance and therefore the idle times at the next collective operations.
Figure \ref{fig:indiVScollecBand} show the measured bandwidths for both runs.
The reached bandwidth is greater than the ones in Figure \ref{schumann:fig:bandwidth}.
Therefore, the reduced version cannot be compared directly to the import module.
The measurements have to be interpreted independently.

\label{schumann:tbl:indevscol}
\end{table}
\subsection{Alltoall step}
The \emph{Alltoall} step contains collective MPI communications.
Inside, \emph{MPI\_alltoall} is called followed by \emph{MPI\_alltoallv}.
The Scalasca analysis highlights the first \emph{MPI\_alltoall} as the bottleneck,
even though the second \emph{MPI\_alltoallv} transfers more data.
This means, that the internal MPI barrier is responsible for the bottleneck.
Thus, it can be traced back to imbalance resulting from the independent read operations.

\subsection{Connect step}
\label{sec:speedup:connect}
Thread parallelization of the connect step allows to store the synapses efficiently in the NEST data structure.
The pure connect functionality of NEST is thread-safe. But creating and destroying SLI data objects is not and can result
in data-races. To overcome this limitation, the creation and destroying of the objects is serialized.
Before iterating over all synapses, one SLI object is created and destroyed afterwards for each thread.
A single connect function call of the NEST api expects the synapse parameters stored in a SLI object.
In each iteration the current parameters are assigned to the values inside the already created SLI object.
This SLI object is passed to the function call.
Thus, a small overhead for the creation and destroying of the objects are perceived.

}
\label{boxplotnewcon}
\end{figure}

Each thread iterates over all synapses, but only stores the connection if the post-synaptic neuron is located on
the thread. Thus, the connection frequency per thread varies.
As for ranks the neurons are distributed in the modules fashion on the threads for one node.
The distribution properties are the same. Thus, there is a larger variation on a larger number of threads.
Figure \ref{boxplotnewcon} shows measured connection frequencies for the connect step. The measurements are
extracted from the execution of the threehundredths circuit. It is executed on 128 nodes with varying number of
threads. The circuit plus fixed number of ranks specify the distribution of neurons per node.

\end{figure}

A larger number of threads leads to smaller wall-clock timings, but the chance of imbalance increases.
%The variations of the timings correlates with the distribution of synapses per node (figure \ref{fullcircuitdist}).
To look into detail, Figure \ref{detailnewcon:second} shows the measured wall-clock time for each node
plotted over the maximum number of new connections per thread. It shows a strong correlation between the variable and
the wall-clock timings. Thus, the increasing variations of timings can be explained by the variations of synapses per thread.
The figure indicates two different timings per connection. There is an offset of regression between the red
(left point cloud)
and the green (right point cloud) dots. Red and green dots represent all measurements with less than $40,000$ and more than new synapses per
node, respectively. Less than $40,000$ new synapses only occurs in the last iteration.
Figure \ref{detailnewcon:first} shows the density of number of new synapses per node.
Less synapses result in a smaller vector size. There seems to be a loss of efficiency, which might result from
the use of different cache levels.

\newpage
\section{Memory consumption}
During the development of the import module, the goal to fit the full mouse brain model on the
Blue Brain 4 seemed to get unrealistic. We make the assumption that the full machine does not deliver enough memory resources for the whole circuit.
Test runs on different scales on the JUQUEEN should give concrete results for the final implementation.
The test runs load the neuron information and the long range synapses.
The long range synapses are approximately 96\% of synapses in the full circuit.
Thus, reducing the test to only the long range synapses is feasible.
We extended the import module with a logging of imported synapses and the used memory at each iteration.
We used a IBM Blue Gene /Q library (see Appendix \ref{bgqmemory}) to measure the memory usage on each node.
The runs on $6$ and $8$ racks executed successfully.
The run on $4$ racks crashed before ending.
It run out of memory.

The green lines show the measurements from a run on 8 racks, the blue ones on 6 racks and the red ones on 8 racks.
The points represent the last iteration per run.
Thus, the program iterates $80$ times on $8$ racks, $107$ times on $6$ racks and $140$ times on $4$ racks.
The numbers 1, 2 and 3 represent references of the mean, minimum and maximum value, respectively.
 }
\label{fig:newconnections}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:newconnections} shows the number of new connections per node for the different runs.
The vertical distance between the dashed and the dotted line reflects the imbalance of synapses between the nodes.
Remarkable is the fact, that the imbalance $||p_2-p_3||$ is similar for the three different scales.
\begin{equation}
	||r_2-r_3|| \approx ||g_2-g_3|| \approx ||b_2-b_3||
\end{equation}
$r_i$, $g_i$ and $b_i$ represent the red, green and blue dots, respectively.
It enables a precise prediction of the needed memory per node.

The points represent the last iteration per run.
The points 1, 2 and 3 represent references of the final mean, minimum and maximum value, respectively.
The run executed on 4 racks ran out of memory. Thus, it crashed before it could read all synapses.
The thin red line represents an estimation for the mean value up to 160 iterations.
The black solid line illustrates the measured memory limit.
The intersection point of the thin red line and the black solid line is referenced with point 1*(red).
 }
\label{fig:memoryplot}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig:memoryplot} shows the memory usage per node for the different runs.
In the first iterations (up to $20$-$40$), the measured used memory stays constant, even thought the number of synapses increases.
The fact is interpreted as imprecise measurements of deallocated memory space.
Thus, the usable free memory is expected to be lower.
This corresponds to the fact, that all lines have a jump in the slope at the same \emph{used memory}.
The black solid line illustrates the memory limit of each node of the IBM Blue Gene /Q.
One sees that for 4 racks, the long range synapses of the full mouse brain model does not fit in memory.
An imbalance compensation would not make the model fit on $4$ racks,
because the needed memory line would cross the memory limit, anyway.
A perfect compensation would result in the memory usage of the measured mean values for each node.
Thus, the intersection point 1*(red) marks the critical point.

Further, the measured values enable an approximation of the memory needed per synapse.
The slope of the mean used memory line divided by the slope of the mean number of synapses line returns
memory needed per synapse:
\begin{equation}
	m_{synapse} = \frac{\Delta memory}{\Delta iteration} * \frac{\Delta iteration}{\Delta synapses} \approx 106
\end{equation}

This results in approximately $106$ Bytes per synapse, which matches with the size of the NEST synapse object.

%Therefore, we estimate the NEST base with neuron information to use 2GB of memory per node.

\section{Conclusion}
The implementations presented in chapter two enables the generation and simulation of a full mouse brain model.
In chapter three the usage of delivered programs are explained. Additionally, an example simulation run is shown.
The neuronal simulator NEST was extended by two import modules.
Chapter three and four present the resulting implementations and their performance.
The achieved performance is feasible.
Even though the main goal of running the full mouse brain model on the Blue Brain 4 is not achieved,
we showed that we can run the simulation on the same system but on larger scale.
We also showed  that the full mouse brain model is memory bound for Blue Gene /Q systems.
Thus, it does not fit on the $4$ racks provided by Blue Brain 4. 
The simulations on the JUQUEEN system was achieved using $6$ racks.

The modules enable to import the full mouse brain model inside of NEST.
A pipeline for generating synapses from Allen Brain injections experiments and the Blue Brain Project recipe
is ported to IBM Blue Gene /Q systems, which can handle the amount of data needed for a full mouse brain simulation.
Besides demonstrating the current neurological possibilities, the work in this thesis extends the neuronal simulator with the feature of loading well-defined
point neuron circuits. An integration of the new import functionality into the \emph{SLI}
interface allows to extend current simulations with well-defined circuit data easily.
The extension of the mouse brain model enables the creation of a full mouse brain model.
This model contains neurons and synapses as they occur in the living animal.
Even though the interpolations introduce errors, a first simulation of the full mouse brain model is possible.
The extension enables the preparation and optimizations of the whole pipeline.
As more and more precise injection experiments are available, they can be integrated into the circuit generation easily.
Additionally, the virtual mouse brain model will stay in the focus of research.
Thus, adaptations in the near future are to be expected.
As more data is available, data-driven neuronal simulations will gain further importance in the field of computational neuroscience.
%NEST is a valuable tool for brain research.
%The implemented module extend its possibilities.
%The used data format is not optimized for the NEST data structure.
%It stores the circuit data in general way to not put any obstacles in the way.

The mouse brain simulation is a first step in direction of the simulation of a human brain. The simulation of large scale data-driven brain models give new perspectives and hopefully new insights of the brain.
This thesis presents that a mouse brain model simulation was possible using modern super computers. Although the human brain is around thousand times bigger than a mouse brain, with the enhancement of super computers, resources and large scale neuronal simulation software we move forward to the creation of a human brain model. 
Implementations, which are presented in the thesis, enable the testing of the pipeline on
large scale machines, which are required for full brain simulations.



\chapter{Prospect}
The introduced pipeline to run large scale data-driven simulation is still experimental.
Even tough, validations are introduced and manipulation functionalities are included, the 
implementations are only used and tested for the given mouse brain model. Further, building a given 
mouse brain model directs the proposed efficiency requirements. Taking into account that
the mouse brain model is still in development, more efficient implementations of the 
circuit generation could be of interest.
Additionally, there are several possibilities for optimizations of different parts of the pipeline in terms of efficiency and usability.

The optimizations proposed in chapter \ref{sec:speedup:load} should be integrated into the synapse import module.
The changes in the internal data structures can be applied to the import module, without major interventions.
As show, collective read operations will improve the performance.

To fit the given full mouse brain model on the Blue Brain 4 (on $4$ racks on IBM Blue Gene /Q system) the precision of the internal synapse model parameters could be reduces.
At the moment, NEST uses double precision
for all parameters in the used synapse model.
But the circuit generation only creates single precision values for the parameters.
The already introduced error wont be aggravated
by reducing the precision of the five parameters.
Changes could reduce the memory needed for a synapse object by $20\%$.

As now a new release of NEST is available, the import module should
be ported to the new version. The implementations are embedded in \emph{NEST 2.6.0}.

The NEST import modules are only accessible via the SLI interface\cite{SLI}.
To make it available for more users the import modules should be integrated into the Python
interface as well. Furthermore, the generated circuit is distributed uniformly by NEST on the nodes. But this is not guaranteed. Therefore, it might me necessary to include reshuffling of neuron distribution to achieve better memory and load balancing in the pipeline.

The simulated mouse brain model does not produce expected activity yet.
The introduced validation are only taking the correct implementation of the algorithms into account.
But the given model was never created and simulation on the full scale. Therefore, the expected outcome is unclear. As soon as the model produces more sensible results, visualisation techniques from the
Blue Brain Project and the RWTH Aachen can give insight of the model behaviour.
